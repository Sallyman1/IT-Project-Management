# Tournament Scoring System

## Project Overview

This project implements a console-based tournament registration and scoring system. Developed as part of my **BTEC Level 3 Extended Diploma in Information Technology, Unit 4: Programming**, this system demonstrates core programming principles by allowing participants to register (individually or as teams), select from a range of events, input their performance ranks, and view a basic leaderboard with calculated points.

The system is designed to provide a foundational understanding of data handling, user interaction, and modular programming, all applied within a practical scenario relevant to event management and data tracking.

## Context: BTEC Level 3 Extended Diploma in Information Technology - Unit 4: Programming

This project was completed as part of **Unit 4: Programming** for my BTEC Level 3 Extended Diploma in Information Technology. It allowed me to apply theoretical programming concepts to a practical, real-world scenario, directly addressing key learning aims of the unit.

Specifically, this project helped me to achieve the following learning aims:

* **Learning Aim A: Examine the computational thinking skills and principles of computer programming.**
    * *Demonstrated by:* Breaking down the complex problem of tournament management into smaller, manageable functions (decomposition), identifying patterns for validation loops, and applying algorithmic thinking for point calculation and data processing.
* **Learning Aim B: Design a software solution to meet client requirements.**
    * *Demonstrated by:* Planning the program's structure (functions, data flow), designing the user interaction prompts, and structuring the logic to meet the requirements for individual/team registration, event selection, and rank input.
* **Learning Aim C: Develop a software solution to meet client requirements.**
    * *Demonstrated by:* Writing, implementing, and debugging the Python code to create a functional system that addresses the specified features, including data input, processing, and output, along with robust error handling.

The development process involved stages such as initial planning, coding the various functions, thoroughly testing its functionality with different inputs, and debugging to ensure it met the specified requirements reliably.

## Features

* **Participant Registration:**
    * Allows registration for individual participants.
    * Allows registration for teams.
* **Event Selection:**
    * Participants (or teams) can choose to participate in a specified number of available events.
    * Validation ensures participants select a valid number of events.
* **Event Ranking Input:**
    * Allows input of ranks for participants/teams in their chosen events.
    * Includes validation to ensure ranks are within the acceptable range based on participant type.
* **Point Calculation:**
    * Awards points based on a predefined ranking system (1st place: 10 points, 2nd: 8 points, 3rd: 6 points).
* **Registration Summary Display:**
    * Provides a clear summary of the participant's/team's registration details.
* **Basic Leaderboard:**
    * Displays the entered ranks and calculated points for each event.
